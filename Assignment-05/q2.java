/*	Q2. Create a class Figure with instance members dim1 and dim2. Use constructor and area() that returns the area of figure. Create a derived class
		Rectangle derived from Figure and area() that returns the area of rectangle. Create another derived class Triangle and Square that has area()
		which returns area of Triangle and Square respectively. Derived class have appropriate constructor. Using method overriding concept test the
		functionalities of derived class by creating objects and super class memory references in Main class.
